***Why warmup?***

This course focuses on helping you improve your problem-solving skills by teaching you how to recognize algorithmic patterns. When studying for coding interviews, it's best to start with easy problems and gradually work your way up. Don't make the mistake of jumping straight into medium or hard problems – it might discourage you and knock your confidence.

Take it slow in the beginning!

Take your time with the easy problems, use them to build up your skills, and when you're ready, tackle the medium ones. If it takes you more than 10-15 minutes to solve an easy problem, don't stress – just keep working on similar easy problems to gain confidence. With this approach, you'll develop the skills needed to successfully solve even the toughest coding problems.

Let's warmup.

I'm going to solve a problem with multiple approaches.

Problems:
1. 217-contains_duplicate.cpp
2. 1832-panagram.cpp
3. 69-sqrt(x).cpp
4.
